=== Using ONS Notification

The {uri-oci-notifications}[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Notifications service] can be configured to receive status messages from your instance when updates have been applied or when a known exploit attempt has been detected by {uri-ksplice}[Ksplice].

==== Enabling ONS Notification for the bastion host

Set the following parameters in the terraform.tfvars in order to enable ONS Notification for the bastion host:

----
  ...
  bastion_notification  = true
  notification_endpoint = "valid_email_address"
  notification_protocol = "EMAIL"
  notification_topic    = "bastion"
  ...

----

If your bastion is already created, set the above parameters in the terraform.tfvars and run terraform apply again:

----
terraform apply
----

You'll then receive a notification email to confirm the subscription.

==== Disabling ONS Notification for the bastion host

Set the following parameters in the terraform.tfvars to disable ONS Notification:

----
  ...
  bastion_notification  = false
  ...

----

and run terraform apply again:
